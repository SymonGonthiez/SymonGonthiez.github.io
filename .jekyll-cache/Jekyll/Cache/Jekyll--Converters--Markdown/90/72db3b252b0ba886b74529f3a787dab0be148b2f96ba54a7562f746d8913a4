I"⁄<center> Learn <b>Efficiently</b> From Method to Smart Drugs.</center>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>This is not going to be a thread about bullsnap like ‚Äòexercise well, eat well, sleep well‚Äô, no. 
After my years in such intense courses I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that for success, this is not possible unless you are borderline obsessive-compulsive or at a functional level of Aspergers. 
This is the real deal on how to succeed.</p>

<p>Topics I will address:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Motivation: identify and develop your motivators for study.</li>
  <li>Attitude: get the right attitude.</li>
  <li>Learn to Learn Effectively: find out your learning style and how can you best study according to it.</li>
  <li>Your Lifestyle and Academic Performance: what factors in your life affect your academic performance and how can you modify these to reach your maximum potential.</li>
  <li>Competing with your Classmates: getting valuable information out of your competition and getting the edge on them - without being a dick!</li>
  <li>Smart Drugs (Nootropics): what ones work, their uses, how to take them and the science backing their use.</li>
  <li>Acing Exams: a review of the physical and mental side of exams and how to maximise your performance in them.</li>
  <li>Assessment Technique: a brief look at how you should best approach assessments to obtain maximum marks.</li>
</ul>

<p>tl;dr : Check these tldr sections to get the key points from a section.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-motivation">1. The Motivation</h2>

<p>This may be the most important factor when it comes to success in your academics. What motivates you to study. 
This will be your key driving force that keeps you going in the early hours of the morning. 
Knowing this will allow you to tailor your environment to inspire and encourage you to learn. 
I want you to take a moment now to think, really think, why is it that you‚Äôre studying what you‚Äôre studying?</p>

<p>‚ÄúMotivation and engagement can be regarded as the driving forces of learning. They can also affect students‚Äô quality of life during their adolescence and can influence whether they will successfully pursue further educational or labour market opportunities.‚Äù</p>

<p>Some definitions to keep in mind:
<b>Extrinsic Motivation</b>: occurs when we are motivated to perform a behavior or engage in an activity to earn a reward or avoid punishment.</p>

<p><b>Intrinsic Motivation</b>: involves engaging in a behavior because it is personally rewarding; essentially, performing an activity for its own sake rather than the desire for some external reward.</p>

<p>Examples of <b>bad</b> motivation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I just want to graduate so I can be called ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù, ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äù. [extrinsic - you want respect off other people]</li>
  <li>I just need to pass so I don‚Äôt have to do again this course. [extrinsic - you don‚Äôt want the inconvenience of lost time]</li>
  <li>I feel guilty because my friends are studying and I am not. [extrinsic]</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of <b>ok</b> motivation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to be better than other drs so they respect me. [extrinsic]</li>
  <li>I want to finish this so I can make some money. [extrinsic]</li>
  <li>I want to impress my family/friends/teacher. [extrinsic]</li>
  <li>I don‚Äôt want to fail (when your definition of failure is less than a distinction). [extrinsic]</li>
  <li>I want to beat my friends and look smarter than them. [extrinsic]</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of the <b>perfect</b> motivation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I want to be the best engineer to I can help change the world for good! [instrinsic]</li>
  <li>I want to be the best computer expert in the world so I can help develop awesome technology for the world! [instrinsic]</li>
  <li>I love learning this because I know it will help me achieve my main goal. [instrinsic]
Some of these may seem intrinsic where I have labelled them extrinsic - why? Because we say one thing but really what we actually mean is something else (the statements in [])!</li>
</ul>

<p>Key to Success: From the examples above, you can see there are forms of extrinsic (external) and intrinsic (internal) things that can motivate you. Intrinsic motivators are higher in quality, however, a fusion of BOTH intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is the <b>KEY</b>.</p>

<p>My advice : Write it down now, What is your intrinsic / extrinsic motivations?</p>

<p>You must to fill your space with stuff that reminds you of both of these things ; intrinsic motivators can be complicated to fill your space with. Once you surround yourself and constantly look at your motivations, they will gradually become ingrained in you and you will no longer require something in order to get motivated.</p>

<p>How I initially surrounded myself with these ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small A4 posters with images of what I will be able to do when I finish my new career and income.</li>
  <li>End goals clearly are written and visible every day.</li>
  <li>Comparing myself to my peers - asking what they have been studying, how they have been going in classes and competing internally (don‚Äôt be a dick when it comes to this - nobody likes a competitive CVNT - if someone asked my grade and they did Clay Davis(hope you got this one) I would just say I passed too, there‚Äôs no honour in making others feel bad. Modesty is a good quality!)</li>
  <li>Tell yourself every day, morning and night in the mirror your intrinsic motivation.</li>
</ul>

<p>tl;dr : Get a good reason to study - otherwise don‚Äôt bother. It should be more meaningful than to win or be the best.</p>
