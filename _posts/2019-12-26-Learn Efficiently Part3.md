## 2.5 Learn to Learn Effectively

You've probably heard it before, we all have different styles that work for us. Let's try and uncover our methods of learning together! Unfortunately, this is an extremely difficult skill to master and individualise (I'll explain my personal techniques at the end). It took me 5 years (of 8 intense fulltime study years) to get to a technique that works best for me and I'm sure it could use refining. 

The 7 Different Learning Styles:

* Visual (spatial): You prefer using pictures, images, and spatial understanding.
* Aural (auditory-musical): You prefer using sound and music.
* Verbal (linguistic): You prefer using words, both in speech and writing.
* Physical (kinesthetic): You prefer using your body, hands and sense of touch.
* Logical (mathematical): You prefer using logic, reasoning and systems.
* Social (interpersonal): You prefer to learn in groups or with other people.
* Solitary (intrapersonal): You prefer to work alone and use self-study.

You may think you know your learning style. If you're like me you don't conform to a single learning style - this is of great benefit if you! If you are certain you only learn from one style I encourage you to try and integrate other methods - there is emerging evidence to support that using a variety of styles increases learning potential.

How I Study:

* Type a summary.
* Make a question sheet directly from my summary and print multiple copies. Make the questions answers ideally in dot point or flow charts and require expansion. 
* I take the first letter from the keywords of dot points and make a word out of them using a scrabble word finder: http://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/ This makes *   recall much easier. 
* Handwrite copying directly 3 times from summary to answers.
* 4th attempt try recalling from memory. 
* Go to whiteboard and recall lists and details.
* Read out loud as writing on the whiteboard and re-read.
* Alternate between paper and white board. 
* Watch youtube videos to reinforce visually and through audio.
* Once I have this down pat I study with friends to cement what I know by talking to them without reference to notes - it also helps me identify areas in which I can    expand or where I may have gone overboard. 

This aligns with my results visual (whiteboard), solitary (initially), logical (drawing connections between information and flow charts really cements knowledge for me), social (to further cement information). 

Once you have determined your learning styles, it's time to start studying according to them. It's safe to say the top 4 results would be highly applicable to you and you should try all 4 methods to the same topic to get the maximum benefit. 

## 3. Lifestyle and Academic Performance

I'm going to start by pointing out the obvious - for best performance you need to have a balanced diet, exercise, sleep etc. I mentioned in the introduction I won't talk about these, much. I'll address the ideal situation, then I'll address the real-life student situation. 

There are several possible direct and indirect pathways linking healthy eating and physical activity with academic achievement. While the current evidence is limited but evolving, it shows that certain factors can improve academic achievement. These factors include access to healthy foods and opportunities to stay physically active. 

Improving access to healthy foods and physical activities is linked to healthier students who are also better learners.

## Evidence on dietary behaviours and academic achievement 

* Student participation in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) School Breakfast Program (SBP) is associated with increased academic grades and standardized test scores, reduced absenteeism, and improved cognitive performance (e.g., memory).

* Skipping breakfast is associated with decreased cognitive performance (e.g., alertness, attention, memory, processing of complex visual display, problem-solving) among students.

* Lack of adequate consumption of specific foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or dairy products, is associated with lower grades among students.
Deficits of specific nutrients (i.e., vitamins A, B6, B12, C, folate, iron, zinc, and calcium) are associated with lower grades and higher rates of absenteeism and tardiness among students.

* Hunger due to insufficient food intake is associated with lower grades, higher rates of absenteeism, repeating a grade, and an inability to focus on students.

# Evidence on physical activity and academic achievement 

* Students who are physically active tend to have better grades, school attendance, cognitive performance (e.g., memory), and classroom behaviours (e.g., on-task behaviour).24–30 

* Higher physical activity and physical fitness levels are associated with improved cognitive performance (e.g., concentration, memory) among students.
More participation in physical education class has been associated with better grades, standardized test scores, and classroom behaviour (e.g., on-task behaviour) among students.

* Time spent in recess has been shown to positively affect students’ cognitive performance (e.g., attention, concentration) and classroom behaviours (e.g., not misbehaving).40–44

* Brief classroom physical activity breaks (i.e., 5-10 minutes) are associated with improved cognitive performance (e.g., attention, concentration), classroom behaviour (e.g., on-task behaviour), and educational outcomes (e.g., standardized test scores, reading literacy scores, math fluency scores) among students.

* Participation in extracurricular physical activities such as interscholastic sports has been associated with higher grade point averages (GPAs), lower drop-out rates, and fewer disciplinary problems among students.

# Evidence on Sleep and academic achievement

From most recent data:

Quote:

*Sleepwalking through School: New Evidence on Sleep and Academic Performance (Wang, K., Sabia, J. J., Cesur, R., (2016))
Our findings provide some evidence that increased sleep duration—up to 8.5 to 9.0 hours per night—is associated with improvements in contemporaneous academic concentration and homework completion. Moreover, increased sleep duration—up to 8.5 10 In addition, as noted above, the effect of sleep duration on academic achievement may operate through sports participation, likelihood of skipping breakfast, and hours of television watching. In Appendix Tables 5 and 6, we estimate the sensitivity of the estimated impact of sleep duration on short-run academic achievement measurement and longer-run educational attainment, respectively. However, these controls appear to be relatively unimportant mediators.*

*7 hours per night—is associated with an increase in the probability high school diploma receipt and college attendance. These results are robust to the inclusion of controls for family- and individual-level unmeasured heterogeneity. Following the “academic optimum” number of hours of sleep documented above, increases in sleep duration are associated with a decline in academic achievement. We also find some evidence that insomnia is associated with diminished short-run, but not longer-run, educational performance. Finally, we find that the educational attainment benefits of increased sleep time can be explained, in part, by concentration-related improvements.*

Evidence on class/lecture attendance and achievement
The data reveals generally poor attendance leads to poor results. There are some localised studies that reveal no statistical significance between attendence and academic performance. 

Quote:

"Factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, affluence, entry pathway, attendance type, year of study, language spoken at home, family responsibilities, distance between home and the university, etc, may also contribute to poor performance and be as important or significant as lecture attendance."

As you can see there are many factors that may contribute to academic performance.  I tried to focus on modifiable  factors. 

tl;dr: eat well, sleep 7-8hrs, attend class, exercise.
