## 2. Attitude

Like most things in life, everything is what you make of it. You can sit, work, and hate your life while you're there waiting for the time you can go home, or you can learn to enjoy it. This is a mental game, how strong is your mind? Many of us have altered [coping mechanisms](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/coping-mechanism) for whatever reason; genetic, developmental, environmental etc. These will be habits. Very hard habits to break. You must be aware of them and checking yourself when you go into these states. This can be enough to permanently alter your attitude. 

The *"This is stupid"* attitude. 
We've all had that moment in geometry or writing essays when we have asked ourselves 'when will I ever need this'.

# REAL WORLD CHECK!

We <b>ALL</b> have to study stuff we don't enjoy/hate! It's important to not look at the subject in a negative view, look at the fundamental issue at hand. This type of forward thinking from a broad perspective is exactly what makes humans so incredible (unfortunately not all of us are capable of doing it without instruction).
You can complain that circle geometry is pointless because you're going to play the triangle in a band, prepare for failure. Sounds harsh? I've watched all my classmates say this stuff and now they're flipping burgers struggling to make ends meet. I hated all these things but could see the broader goal of what I was working towards. 

<b>Here's a secret to help you stop feeling sorry for yourself...</b>
Can you guess the real reason why we do AP calculus and not learn simply how to do your taxes or buy a house? It's to teach you the process of thinking! If you can learn AP calculus you can learn something as simple as buying a house or doing your taxes. You may not know the deep details of tax, but that's why we have accountants! Those people who are better in calculus, generally have a greater aptitude for that type of critical thinking and therefore are most likely to perform better than their poorer scoring peers in jobs where critical thinking is required (engineers, doc, etc).

The *"I don't need to study to be successful"* attitude. 
You may be right! You may not have to! However, these days with increasing populations, 3rd world countries are developing a greater and greater competition for schools and jobs ! Gone are the days of our parents/grandparents where they could do what they wanted (assuming they had enough money). Education is a good way to safeguard your future (well more so). 

*"But Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates etc didn't graduate from College!"*
Yeah, but they dropped out of Harvard. HARVARD. Not some generic college that lets anyone in. They obviously had awesome scores and an impeccable aptitude for learning to be admitted into Harvard. So, next argument please. 

*Indifference and Frustration*
The statements above probably all come down to these emotions. So it is these emotions that will control your performance and determine success. 

Indifference - meaning 'not giving a fucc'.
I don't have a hard and fast solution for you stopping giving a fucc. That's completely internal. 

Here are some suggestions:

* <b>Do you have an inspiration?</b> If not research and get one for anything you want to succeed in. You don't need just one inspiration, I have many when it comes to different aspects of life. Friends I have met abroad that inspire me in terms of my way of life, Bill Gates for his philanthropic work, Elon Musk for his thinking... 

* <b>Are you surrounded by motivated people?</b> Maybe you're surrounded by people (friends, family, colleagues) that simply do not wish to achieve. Then make new friends! I'm not saying dump them, these days you can so easily connect with people who have similar ambitions and interests through forums, social media, discords and more!

* <b>Do you lack clear goals?</b> Put time aside to research, travel, talk to people to identify goals. When you're able to identify a larger goal, break these goals down into smaller achievable goals! 

* <b>Do you not find class interesting?</b> Sit in the front row and pay more attention, ask to change classes, ask to change subjects, change schools or my personal favourite. **TEACH YOURSELF!** This is the 21st century and we can easily find torrent textbooks for free, online courses, podcasts, countless youtube videos, sites dedicated to your course. We are so lucky to have more resources than just the teacher in front of us! There is no excuses for not doing this. I came from one of the worst ranked schools in my nation however I had an internet connection and youtube was my best friend! I taught myself maths, algorithms, AI, Blockchain, etc. So you can teach yourself elementary maths from youtube. 

<b>Frustration</b>

It is unrealistic to believe you can rid yourself of frustration forever, but you can learn to do things to minimize your frustrations and to make sure you do not engage in unhealthy responses to frustration. You will need to learn to distinguish between what you hope will happen, what will probably happen, and what actually happened.  Life inevitably has its ups and downs - its moments of relaxation and times of tension. When you learn to truly accept this reality, you come one step closer to being able to deal with frustration in a healthy way.

Identify what you are frustrated by. We can choose whether to be frustrated and give up (entrapment), or frustrated and cope (fight). You can decide how you respond. Below is an illustrated pathway of how we respond to threats or stresses. Humans are highly adaptive when it comes to these situations - you must just be willing to alter the path your brain chooses to follow. Entrapment, or cope. Fight, or withdraw.

If you're finding yourself struggling to follow the coping pathway even after this guide, perhaps it's time to seek professional help in the form of a psychologist. Can't afford a psychologist? Here is a book on cognitive behavioural therapy that will teach you the methods psychologists will help you alter your response pathways: "Change Your Thinking" by Sarah Edelman. Also available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/Change-Thinking-Third-Sarah-Edelman-ebook/dp/B00ALM730W).

<b>So how will you deal with the frustration?</b>

* Ask for help from your teacher.
* Take breaks time.
* Review difficult concepts often so you don't forget them.
* Write things down (we will get into study technique later). 
* Study harder and harder.
* Seek additional help from a mentor.

<b>A deeper look at dealing with your frustrations:</b>

* Have Realistic Goals: if you can't add up 2+2 today don't expect to be doing complex polynomials the day after. Take your time and reward yourself when you make positive progress.

* Feed Your Passions: some people are just terrible at complex mathematics but excel and take pride in art. Appreciate what you do well and notice that you are capable of things. 

* Be Persistent: success comes easier to others, but we all struggle. When things get hard, fight harder. The feeling when I'm memorising a list of 20 korean words and finally get them is amazing. The more persistent you are, the better you will get at conquering your struggles. 

* Have Gratitude: this is my number one tip and has got me through some of the toughest of times in my academic career! If you're reading me right now then you probably have some form of an electronic device with an internet connection. Remind yourself of how lucky you are to be in the position you are in! 
Children are starving to death in Africa, dying of terrible diseases, can't have proper education. That's the common lot in the world but so many forget it. Be grateful and learn for those who cannot. 

* Develop Resilience: this ties in with the flow-chart above. We all have (well ME! maybe not 'all') failed something or multiple things! Like actual fail, less than 0%. I remember my first algorithm exam I got something like 30% of good answers! I was so disappointed in myself at the age of 18. Only 2 people passed (narrowly!). Half the people dropped the class too because they failed. I took this mark onboard and worked 10x harder than ever before - because I didn't want the feeling of failure I experienced again (see extrinsic motivation - this was my early days of education before I taught myself to succeed)... I ended up having my exam and finally my degree.

tl;dr: Get inspired and set clearly defined goals. We all have to do stuff we don't want to do in-order to **achieve** a goal. Surround yourself with motivated people (in person or online). Have gratitude for your ability to even get to learn and have access to the internet. Be **resilient**! 

Part 3 will talk about studying / memorizing methods.

Thanks for your time.
